This is an (incomplete) implementation of GAL, the Genetic Automaton Learner as 
defined in Chapter 5 of Belz (2000).

The point of this code is to learn a FSA that *generalizes* from a set of positive
examples. (If you just want to cover exactly the input, you can use any existing
package for doing FSA minimization.)

The input file is in text format, one sequence per line, the alphabet will be induced
by tokens separated by white-spaces.

This project currently builds under Eclipse, feel free to contribute an ant script.


To run an example, use the LearnFSA run configuration in run_config/

To create a graph from the output, install the package graphviz and use

  dot -Tpng best-instance.dot > best-instance.png
  
Take a look at the PNG in the repository for an example of the learned automata.

Edit the default.properties to get better goodness of fit. Read chapter 5 of Belz (2000)
for more details and for further ideas about how to improve it. Patches are welcomed.
